## GridRFunctionNd

The SCC::GridFunctionNd classes N = 1,2,3 are grid function classes with mathematical vector structure.


Warning : The GridFunctionNdUtility classes have been changed significantly from previous releases. This change resulted in a modification of the structure of output data files. A consequence of this modification is the input and output routines have changed, and so old data files written with previous versions cannot be read. This revision of the utility classes did not require any changes in the GridFunctionNd classes.
